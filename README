Simple HTTP server indended for experimenting with GC behavior.

Easiest way to run it (assumes you have maven2 installed) plainly
without particular VM options is:

  mvn compile
  mvn clojure:run

Easiest way to produce an executable jar and run it using "./run.sh"
is:

  mvn package
  ./run.sh

If you want to drive the generation of transient data, you may wish to
use something like ab:

  ab -k -c 100 -n 200000 http://localhost:9191/gengarbage

In order to generate persistent data:

  curl http://localhost:9191/gendata

to double the amount of permanent data kept on the keap (or specify
"amount" parameter). To drop permanent data, request:

  http://localhost:9191/dropdata

You can use 'ratio' and 'amount parameters. One way to generate steady
state is to repeatedly do something like:

  curl 'http://localhost:9191/dropdata?ratio=0.10'
  curl 'http://localhost:9191/gendata?amount=10000'
